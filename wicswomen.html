           During World War II, the computer science field was shockingly dominated by women, however, computers were much different. Alan Turing, who is considered to be the father of computer science, created the first computational device, or computer, to break a German code during the war. Although this accomplishment was amazing and remarkably helpful, the computer could only work with text and decipher written words that were encrypted. However. when difficult equations were on the rise, it became more important than ever to compute complicated numbers as quickly as possible. To solve this problem, Pennsylvania University created another computer that handled these difficult equations. This computer was originally built by men, but then programed by only a few women. After the war, the number of female computer scientists only rose through time.
      In 1984, 37% of all programmers were women, which is currently the highest percent of women working in computer science. However, over the years that number plummeted to a measly 18% in 2016. Researchers believe that this is due to the fact that when personal computers became available to the public, they were more marketed towards men and people were more inclined to buy personal computers for sons instead of daughters, thus women never had the chance to explore computer science or engineering, causing the percent to drop (Weston). Also, studies have shown that teachers and schooling have a large effect on the likelihood of women going into computer science. Students before the age of fourteen who are encouraged to go into computer science are up to three times more likely to enter the field. Another reason could also be media representation. In media, most programmers are seen to be geeky males deemed outcasts or nerds among society, thus giving computer science a bad reputation. This could discourage women from joining the field because programmers are incorrectly represented among the media, which causes the public to think ill of them. Even with the smallest pay gap between women and men professionals, with women getting paid 94% of what men get paid, there are still very few female programmers (Vu).
