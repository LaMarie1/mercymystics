  <p><b>Ada Lovelace</b></p>

  Ada Lovelace</div> </div>

<p> Born Ada Byron in 1815, daughter of Lord Byron, became known as the first programmer. At around seventeen years old, she met a man named Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor, who became somewhat as a mentor. He became known as the father of the computer because of his invention of the analytical engine, which was invented to handle complex calculations. Ada was one person who learned about the machine and what it does. She was also tasked with translating the notes for the machine, which were written in Italian, into English. Not only did she translate, but she also added in her own notes and theories, which ended up being three times longer than the original article. In her notes, she covered how the machine could learn to take letters and symbols as well as numbers and how the machine can repeat a set of instructions. That theory was one of the first concepts of looping, which is not used in computer science today. For her work in machine programming and her forward-thinking ideas, Ada is considered to be the first computer programmer.</p>

  <p><b>Sister Mary Kenneth Keller</b></p>
</div>

Sister Mary Kenneth Keller first joined a Roman Catholic order of sisters, the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, when she was just eighteen years old. She earned her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science from DePaul University and participated in a summer institute with Dartmouth University in the late '50s. Soon after, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller became the first person in the United States to earn a Ph.D. in computer science. She also founded one of the first computer science departments at Clarke University in Iowa, where she taught for eighteen years. She also worked incredibly hard in trying to get computing accessible to everyone.

  <p><b>Evelyn Boyd Granville</b></p>
</div>

<p> Born in 1924 and living in Washington, Evelyn Boyd Granville lived during segregation. She talked about how she loved school and how she went to a very good school with trained teachers and good supplies, and how she was encouraged by the school to develop her passion for mathematics. She then attended Smith College and graduated summa cum laude with honors in mathematics. She attended Yale for a graduate school and became the second African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics from an American University. She found work at International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and worked on a team with NASA in their Vanguard Computing Center in Washington D.C. Later, she decided it was best for her to resign from IBM, although she continued to work as a professor for Mathematics in many different Universities across the country.
